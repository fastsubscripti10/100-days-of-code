# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 27, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Learnt basic concepts, functions and arguments for Flutter and practiced Dart on VS Code.

**Thoughts:** Widget structure and const structures i will need to get used to. Class structure and wrapping reusable classes separetely reminded me CSS class structure which i practiced for a little before.

**Link to work:** Not started one yet. I will update this section later on when i get a hold of Flutter concepts. I will do a side project besides following the @maxedapps's Udemy course.
